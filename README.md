# card-pairing-game
A game to pair cards

The game starts with 20 cards, two from 10 different one. Player selcets them by clicking. When two are selected and they match, then they stay upwards. (They are pulled out from the game.) If the two cards don't match, they turn back. 
The steps are counted. Turning up a card is one step. The less steps are the winner!
